### Hi there üëã

I am a Research Assistant at the University of Waterloo. My favorite language to speak is Python! Since she is cute and powerful. To be honest, this is not my first relationship! Since I was a highschool student(2010) until 2018, I was in love with c++. I was into Embedded Systems programming using that language to make things become smart. I did my Masters in Computer Science department of the University of Waterloo, where my reaserch was focused on my childhood passion, IoT. We invented a new method to minimize power consumption of IoT devices and [we patented that](https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/a2/38/c3/7013ac293ff7c3/US20210288755A1.pdf). Also, during my Masters program, I published [a number of papers](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=iWgKz8YAAAAJ) in top confrences of our field.
