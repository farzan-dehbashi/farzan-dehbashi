## Who am I?
I am a Research Assistant at the University of Waterloo. My favorite language to speak is Python! Since she is cute and powerful. To be honest, this is not my first relationship! Before my break up at 2018, I was in love with C++ for almost 8 years, when I first got to know her as a highschool student. I was into Embedded Systems programming using that language to make things become smart. I did my Masters in Computer Science department of the University of Waterloo, where my reaserch was focused on my childhood passion, IoT. During my Masters years, we invented a new method to minimize power consumption of IoT devices like no other technique of the same kind and [we patented that](https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/a2/38/c3/7013ac293ff7c3/US20210288755A1.pdf). Also, I published [a number of papers](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=iWgKz8YAAAAJ) in the best confrences of our field.

I may summerize my passion as what follows:

hii
```go
python inLove([]string{"@elahe-dastan", "c", "golang", "python3", "react", "rust"})
go research([]string{"IoT"})

for aLive() == true {
  eat()
  code()
  sleep()
}
```
